## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to explore the cacao production on the African continent.


### Methods Used
* Explarotary Data Analysis
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* etc.

## Project Description
This project offers a detailed examination of cocoa production metrics within prominent African cocoa-producing countries: Cameroon, Congo, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, and Togo. It aims to rank these nations by production volume and assess the factors contributing to their yields. The analysis extends to understanding the lower production levels in certain countries. By providing a clear production profile, the project serves as a foundational resource for further research into the region's cocoa industry dynamics.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*

3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages)
create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*
